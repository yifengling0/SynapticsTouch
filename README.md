import the reg file.

# Lumia930

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\RTSYSTEM\TOUCH\SCREENPROPERTIES]
"DisplayViewableHeight"=dword:00000598
"DisplayViewableWidth"=dword:00000a49

# Lumia1520

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\RTSYSTEM\TOUCH\SCREENPROPERTIES]
"DisplayViewableHeight"=dword:00000595
"DisplayViewableWidth"=dword:00000a54


# Notice: For other lumias you should  calc the adjust value by yourself.

DisplayViewableWidth = RESOLUTION_X / 816 *  RESOLUTION_X

DisplayViewableHeight = RESOLUTION_Y / 1394 *  RESOLUTION_Y

816/1394 is the value which was founded in stock driver. 
seem all the same.
